# Examine Text Collection Log Plugin
This is a simple plugin designed to allow you to track how many unique examine text strings you can find in the Old School Runescape.

NOTE: This is not meant to be the most serious of plugins. One could quite easily add fake examine texts to the saved txt file and artificially increase their count. The code is also not pretty or commented well. This is more of a dumb POC more than anything
